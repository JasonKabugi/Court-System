    -FORM is for input area.
     -ACTION = LOGIN.PHP is to show data is being sent to login.php once submit is clicked.
     -METHOD specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data. 
    -POST is used because the submitted form data is not shown in the URL. 
    -Didn't use GET because we are sending sensitive data. (the submitted form data is visible in the
    URL!) the details that you put in the form(e.g, username or password will appear in the url)
    On top of that, POST has so size limitation and form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked 
    unlike with Get which can be bookmarked.
    -AUTOCOMPLETE is off to prevent unauthorized access. If someone gains
    access to the device that (eg. a judge) uses to access the system, the
    autocomplete being on will make it easy for someone else to gain access,
    thats why it is off 
    ENCTYPE is for saying how form data should be encoded. here i decided to use application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    because All characters are encoded before sent (spaces are converted to "+" symbols, and special characters are
    converted to ASCII HEX values)
    -->

    <form action="login.php" method="post" autocomplete="off" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
      <!--LABEL is to allow for you to click 'username' and the input field will be activated thus allowing 
      you to type in the input box-->

      <label for="UserID"> Username:</label><br />
      <!--INPUT allows for input. ID connects to the the UserID and name connects to Username-->
      <input type="text" id="UserID" name="Username" required /><br />
      <!--REQUIRED makes it impossible to submit without filling out the space or the info block-->

      <!--This one is to put a password, its required, dunno what else to say, i might add something cool later-->
      <label for="pswd"> Password:</label><br />
      <input type="password" id="pswd" name="Password" required /><br />
      <!--SUBMIT is to submit data-->
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
